    # Introduction: Testing IBEIS on a New Species

    This document is an IPython Notebook that summarizes a preliminary test
    of IBEIS on a new species. It includes steps (a) set up and configure
    the IBEIS image analysis code for a new data set, (b) run the core of
    this code, and (c) examine the results.

    To set the stage for what we are testing here, let's jump ahead to think
    about how IBEIS will work once we have built a database from initial
    training images for a species of interest. Given this database, IBEIS
    applies the following steps to each new set of images uploaded:

    1.  Gather the images taken at the same time and location (when known)
        to form what's known as an *occurrence*. Each image set is broken up
        into one or more occurrences.

    2.  Apply a *detection* process to each image to automatically find
        animals, to draw a bounding box around each, to label the species,
        and to determine the viewpoint on the animal. Together, this
        information forms an *annotation*.

    3.  Within each occurrence find all annotations that are the same
        animal, creating what IBEIS calls an *encounter.* If there are
        pictures of, say, five different animals in the occurrence then five
        encounters should be formed. Sometimes, of course, when animals are
        seen individually only one encounter will be formed.

    4.  Assign a *name* to the animal in each encounter by matching the
        annotations in the encounter against the database of animals. When
        this determines that an animal is previously unknown, a new name
        will be created and added to the database. Information about each
        encounter is also added to the database.

    Steps 3 and 4 are different applications of an underlying identification
    process whose goal is to determine which annotations show the same
    animal. The success of identification is the key to the success of
    IBEIS's image analysis. Therefore, the experiments reported in this
    IPython notebook are designed to study how well the current
    identification algorithms work by simulating Step 4 of the image
    analysis process – the hardest step. In addition to seeing how well the
    current IBEIS algorithms work, these tests can also suggest ways to
    improve the algorithms for the new species.

    Please note that the first three sections below – with (Code) in their
    title - can be safely skipped. They were generated by the IBEIS team to
    run the results here.

        We’d like to be able to identify an animal even if we haven’t seen it

        # Annotation Identification Accuracy: (% correct annotations)

        The first and toughest test of the IBEIS identification algorithm is to
        take each annotation by itself and attempt to identify it. This is done
        by forming a database from other the annotations in the test suite and
        running the identification algorithm against this database. Other
        annotations from the same encounter as this “query annotation” are
        excluded. This is repeated for each annotation. This is the toughest
        test of image analysis because each annotation must be matched on its
        own, without any help from other annotations in the encounter. So, for
        example, if the encounter includes annotations showing both the left and
        right flank of the animal, but no other annotations in the test suite
        show this animal’s right flank, there is no hope for success in
        identifying the animal from just the right flank annotation.

        Results are shown below in both textual form and in a bar graph. It is
        probably best to skip to the bar graph. At this point, we should make
        something clear: the identification algorithm is really a ranking
        algorithm. In other words, when matching the annotation, a score is
        generated for each named animal in the database and names (and scores)
        are returned ordered by the scores. The goal is for the correct name to
        always be ranked first, but if it is ranked near the top it is usually
        ok too because the users of IBEIS make the final decisions about the
        identifying (and therefore naming) the animals.

        The second test of the IBEIS identification algorithm – the most
        important test from the user’s perspective – is to take all the
        annotations in each encounter and together use them to determine the
        identity of the animal shown in the encounter. Once again, this is done
        by forming a database from the other annotations in the test suite. We
        perform this test because IBEIS algorithms combine information from
        matching for each annotation in an encounter to determine the final
        score for each possible name and thereby the final name ranking.

        Identifying an animal using all the annotations in an encounter almost
        always improves the scoring and ranking results. This is one reason why
        we strongly encourage users of the system to take and contribute several
        different images of each animal they encounter and not try to choose the
        “best” to contribute! This simplifies the user’s job and makes the IBEIS
        software as effective as possible.

        # Examples of Top Scoring Successes:

        The next four sections including this one show examples of Annotation
        Identifications that are successes (top ranked) and failures (not top
        ranked). In each case results are shown in rows of two side-by-side
        blocks of annotations. Each block includes two, three or four
        annotations. In a block the left or upper left is the “query
        annotation”, i.e. the one IBEIS is trying to identify. This annotation
        has a purple border around it. Next to it and (when there are four
        annotations) below it are shown a set of “other” database annotations.
        When the identification is correct, these other annotations are all from
        the same name as the query annotation. These are framed in green. When
        the identified name is incorrect these other database annotations – all
        from the incorrect name - are framed in red.

        For the top scoring successes, we show strong true positives in the
        block on the left and the next best scoring true negative in the block
        on the right. Two rows of blocks are shown for each result, with the top
        row showing just the two blocks of annotations, and the blocks in the
        bottom row show the annotations together with matching regions linked by
        a line segment between annotations. The links go from the query
        annotation to the database annotations. Usually the links are to
        multiple database annotations (for the same animal) since information
        from more than one annotation is used to make decisions. Showing these
        matches allows us to understand what the image analysis algorithm used
        to score the match.

        (Notice that sometimes you will see matches between the background
