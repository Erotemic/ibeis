Algorithms for finding k-edge-augmentations

A k-edge-augmentation is a set of edges, that once added to a graph, ensures
that the graph is k-edge-connected. Typically, the goal is to find the
augmentation with minimum weight. In general, it is not gaurenteed that a
k-edge-augmentation exists.

    """Finds set of edges to k-edge-connect G.

    This function uses the most efficient function available (depending on the
    value of k and if the problem is weighted or unweighted) to search for a
    minimum weight subset of available edges that k-edge-connects G.
    In general, finding a k-edge-augmentation is NP-hard, so solutions are not
    garuenteed to be minimal.


    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    k : Integer
        Desired edge connectivity

    avail : dict or a set 2 or 3 tuples
        The available edges that can be used in the augmentation.

        If unspecified, then all edges in the complement of G are available.
        Otherwise, each item is an available edge (with an optinal weight).

        In the unweighted case, each item is an edge ``(u, v)``.

        In the weighted case, each item is a 3-tuple ``(u, v, d)`` or a dict
        with items ``(u, v): d``.  The third item, ``d``, can be a dictionary
        or a real number.  If ``d`` is a dictionary ``d[weight]``
        correspondings to the weight.

    weight : string
        key to use to find weights if avail is a set of 3-tuples where the
        third item in each tuple is a dictionary.

    partial : Boolean
        If partial is True and no feasible k-edge-augmentation exists, then all
        available edges are returned.

    Returns
    -------
    aug_edges : a generator of edges. If these edges are added to G, then
        the G would become k-edge-connected. If partial is False, an error
        is raised if this is not possible. Otherwise, all available edges
        are generated.

    Notes
    -----
    When k=1 this returns an optimal solution.

    When k=2 and avail is None, this returns an optimal solution.
    Otherwise when k=2, this returns a 2-approximation of the optimal solution.

    For k>3, this problem is NP-hard and this uses a randomized algorithm that
        produces a feasible solution, but provides no gaurentees on the
        solution weight.

    This is an implementation of the algorithm detailed in [1]_.
    The basic idea is to construct a meta-graph of bridge-ccs, connect leaf
    nodes of the trees to connect the entire graph, and finally connect the
    leafs of the tree in dfs-preorder to bridge connect the entire graph.

    Notes
    -----
    Input: a graph G.
    First find the bridge components of G and collapse each bridge-cc into a
    node of a metagraph graph C, which is gaurenteed to be a forest of trees.

    C contains p "leafs" --- nodes with exactly one incident edge.
    C contains q "isolated nodes" --- nodes with no incident edges.

    Theorem: If p + q > 1, then at least :math:`ceil(p / 2) + q` edges are
        needed to bridge connect C. This algorithm achieves this min number.

    The method first adds enough edges to make G into a tree and then pairs
    leafs in a simple fashion.

    Let n be the number of trees in C. Let v(i) be an isolated vertex in the
    i-th tree if one exists, otherwise it is a pair of distinct leafs nodes
    in the i-th tree. Alternating edges from these sets (i.e.  adding edges
    A1 = [(v(i)[0], v(i + 1)[1]), v(i + 1)[0], v(i + 2)[1])...]) connects C
    into a tree T. This tree has p' = p + 2q - 2(n -1) leafs and no isolated
    vertices. A1 has n - 1 edges. The next step finds ceil(p' / 2) edges to
    biconnect any tree with p' leafs.

    Convert T into an arborescence T' by picking an arbitrary root node with
    degree >= 2 and directing all edges away from the root. Note the
    implementation implicitly constructs T'.

    The leafs of T are the nodes with no existing edges in T'.
    Order the leafs of T' by DFS prorder. Then break this list in half
    and add the zipped pairs to A2.

    The set A = A1 + A2 is the minimum augmentation in the metagraph.

def weighted_bridge_augmentation(G, avail, weight=None):
    """Finds an approximate min-weight 2-edge-augmentation of G.

    This is an implementation of the approximation algorithm detailed in [1]_.
    It chooses a set of edges from avail to add to G that renders it
    2-edge-connected if such a subset exists.  This is done by finding a
    minimum spanning arborescence of a specially constructed metagraph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    avail : set of 2 or 3 tuples.
        candidate edges (with optional weights) to choose from

    weight : string
        key to use to find weights if avail is a set of 3-tuples where the
        third item in each tuple is a dictionary.

    Returns
    -------
    aug_edges (set): subset of avail chosen to augment G

    Notes
    -----
    Finding a weighted 2-edge-augmentation is NP-hard.
    Any edge not in ``avail`` is considered to have a weight of infinity.
    The approximation factor is 2 if ``G`` is connected and 3 if it is not.
    Runs in :math:`O(m + n log(n))` time
