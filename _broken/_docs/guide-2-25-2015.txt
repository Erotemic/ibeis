ON ENCOUNTERS:
    I recommend just keeping everything in the same monolithic encounter. 
    I would only break up annotations into encounters if the single monolithic
    encounter gets to be too slow. When encounters are being used exemplars
    become much more important. 
    

MATCHING NEW IMAGES:
    Import images via ``1) Detection'' import button or drag and drop

    Select the species you are working with. 

    OPTIONAL: Click ``2) Group''. This will only breakup images in the ``Ungrouped Encounter''

    IMPORTANT: Ensure your current species of interest is correctly selected in
    the ``Species Selector'' combo box. 

    Click ``3) Detection''

    Fix detections using the Image Table and the edit detection interface.
       * new features here: right click will resize the bounding box to be at the
       bottom left corner. This means you can line up the top right corner 

    If everything you want to match is within a single encounter:

        Run ``Intra Encounter Query'' or VsExemplar
            (Note: only will query UNKNOWN animals, 
             you can use Batch->Compute Batch Intra Encounter 
             OR Batch->Compute Batch Vs Exemplar 
             to compute UNKNOWN animals)

        Use the right click + 'T/F' keys to quickly go through obvious matches/non-matches
        Use the review interface to inspect the hard one or do non-trial join/splits


CHOOSING EXEMPLARS:
     Choosing exemplars is independent of matching (but can optionally be done
     while querying by right clicking and setting the flag).

     Option1:
         The best way to choose exemplars is to open the ``Tree of Names'' and
         expand each animal and appropriately set the exemplar checkboxes. 
         However this way requiers a lot of mental work. 

         This way may now be a little easier because I unhid the
         #Exemplars-per-name column in the NameTree.

     Option2:
         An easier way (more clicks, but less thought) to set exemplars is to open
         the Annotations Table and edit the quality and viewpoint columns. It is
         easiest to do this in multiple passes. I typically copy the word ``left''
         into my paste buffer and scroll through and paste ``left'' into all of the
         images of left-side zebras. I then sort to find the None viewpoints and
         repeat the process with right, back, front, frontleft, frontright,
         backleft, and backright. 

         Setting viewpoint is more imporant than setting quality. The valid quality
         strings are perfect, good, ok, bad, junk, and UNKNOWN. It is most important
         to set the junk annotations. It is second-most important to set either the
         good or perfect qualities (it is find if a perfect annotation is marked as
         good). I recommend iterating through good/ok/junk and ignoring perfect and
         bad. 

         If viewpoints and qualities are set (or at least partially set) use Batch
         -> Set Exemplars from Quality and Viewpoint.  This will currently try to
         pick the 3 best images per-name, per-viewpoint.  In the case of ties it
         defers to images that are previously set as exemplars, 

         so if you really want an image to be an exemplar set its quality to perfect
         and its exemplar flag to 1.
    

OPTIONAL:
   * Single Annotation Query:
       You can run any single annotation as a query if there is a specific one of
       interest. Do this by clicking the annotation to select it (you will see its
       aid appear in the statusbar on the bottom) and then click Action -> Query
       Single Annotation. You will see the top 6 ranks for this animal.
       IntraEncounter and vsExemplar mode for this can be toggled by using
       Options->Toggle Query Mode

   * Edit Detections / Image Annotations from Annotation Table:
       When I am editing viewpoint / quality I might see an annotation that
       needs a better bounding box. You can right click an annotation row in the
       Annotations Table and click ``Edit Annotation in Image'' which brings up
       the edit detection interface. 

   * Goto Image/Name/Annotation:
      In the annotation and name table sometimes I want to pop to the
      corresponding row in a second table. You can right click ``Goto
      Annotation'', ``Goto Image'', or ``Goto Name''. 

      Sometimes the scrolling for this doesnt work perfectly, but it often gets
      you in the ballpark. Scroll around (usually down) and the correct row is
      always selected in blue. 


Fixing Errors:
   The help menu has debugging tools, consistency checks, and fixes to common
   issues. 

   * Fix/Clean Database is a good starting point if something goes wrong. 

   * Run Consistency Checks is also a good thing to do if the error persists.
   It might suggest a fix, but usually these problems (should never arise) are
   solved by the fix scripts. 

   * View Log Directory will get you to the logfiles. You can run ibeis with a
   --verbose, --veryverbose, and --debug2 flag to get more output. There is also 
   a --help flag, but be aware that this list of flags is incomplete.

   * A bad cache might could cause problems. Help -> Delete Database Cache will blow the
   cache away for the current database. 

   * Dev -> Refresh Tables might fix an issue if the tables are failing to
   refresh.

   The other options available are more niche cases.


Speedups:
   * Slow image thumbnail load time can be aleveat using Batch -> Precompute
   Thumbnails. 

   * Slow annotation thubnail load time can be aleveated using Batch -> Precompute
   Chips / Fetaures


Other: 
    I have never clicked the ``5) Complete Button''. I think it does something with
    wild book, but I don't know exactely what it does. I'd ask Jason.
