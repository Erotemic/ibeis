Write hard tags to notes w/ experiment_harness

Encounter tests is failing oddly (different results different machines)


+----------------------------
|  [TYPE]
|  GUI / Style Issue
|  
|  [EXPLINATION]
|  IBIES attempts to conform to a "what you see is what you get" coding style. 
|  Ideally this means that there are no unexplicit aliases or weird conditionals
|  based on names. The ecnounter implementation does not conform to this. 
|  An encounter in ['', 'database', 'None', None] all mean the same thing, and 
|  they shouldn't. Yet there needs to be a notion of no encounters. This is
|  tricky when using Qt, because you need to send signals with predetermined
|  types. I don't believe None can be one. 
|  
|  [TASK]
|  Figure out way to make encounters conform to the  "what you see is what you get" 
|  coding style. Maybe there should be a default "database" encounter. But I
|  don't like that either. I don't know what the answer is yet
