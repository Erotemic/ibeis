Write hard tags to notes w/ experiment_harness

Encounter tests is failing oddly (different results different machines)


+----------------------------
|  [TYPE]
|  GUI / Style Issue
|  
|  [EXPLINATION]
|  IBIES attempts to conform to a "what you see is what you get" coding style. 
|  Ideally this means that there are no unexplicit aliases or weird conditionals
|  based on names. The ecnounter implementation does not conform to this. 
|  An encounter in ['', 'database', 'None', None] all mean the same thing, and 
|  they shouldn't. Yet there needs to be a notion of no encounters. This is
|  tricky when using Qt, because you need to send signals with predetermined
|  types. I don't believe None can be one. 
|  
|  [TASK]
|  Figure out way to make encounters conform to the  "what you see is what you get" 
|  coding style. Maybe there should be a default "database" encounter. But I
|  don't like that either. I don't know what the answer is yet

[task] 
Merge IBEIS databases
[description]
Write a function which takes a target database and a list of database to merge
into it.  Extract the information out of those databases and merge them into
the new database.

[task] 
Find knee in roiscore graph
[description] 
find a cuttoff to assign scores as a very probable match scores above this are
marked as true, or use this to build a real make a function mapping the score
to a PDF
L----------------





* adjust layout (let user specify settings)
* make new figures not pop up behind old ones
* refresh figures on database change
* show relevant info in qres figure (config id?)
* quick way of inspecting encounters 

* quick way of tagging images (implement next / prev) 
* integrate the new ROI selection ability

* Select more than one image to view together (in encounter tabs)

* Quick option of linking identities










* Review list of matches (given within-encounter names)
* Mark matches as correct
* Mark viewpoints as similar or different (don't add two of the same view into
* the database)
* Need concept for ROIs marked for recognition database


* Ol' Pejeta plains datasets

* Encounter tab reworking

* Verify detection 

* Location data from EXIF
- bugs
- missing


* Definition of primary encounter - computation 


Current workflow 
- import goes into database (consider prefilter)
- Can launch detect (several species) 
- need to review (current review each with old code)

- Reconfigure encounter
*(encounter click generates tab) 


Add view of detection internals

900 giraffes /manual semiautomatic rois

-managable view of encouner and matching including nameing 

maybe threshold for scores

tests case failure interation betweeen rois and encounters

Software and Test:

Data: 
 - Rose Mary's Ol Pej Plains 
 - Giraffes
 - Anything else from Dan and Tanya


Packaging: 
 - software tools 
 - matlab
 - download and install
 - install scripts

Detector interfcae and review internals
 - Visualization of detector results
 - Integrate Dan's adjust ROIs 
 - Integrate Jon's painting code. 
 - Review interface


Encounter id/ interface
- Table or list of valid encounters
- Open / close encounters in tabs
- Review matches within encounter / database
- Final decision interface
- Fix failed ibeis/tests/test_ibs_encounters.py


Export to wildbook: 
- Packaging of annotations 
- Translation of terminology / data schemas
- security issues with Jason Holmberg

Testing: 
- Across systems 
- Usability

Alg size:

Preprocessing: 
-GIST
-EXIF for location MK
-Change and add EXIF Data
-GoPros (headcams)
- needs encounter algorithm which uses time and space. 
(Assigned to MK)


Detection: 
 - Non-max supression
 - Viewpoint integration of DPM (detectors that work on butts and heads)
 - Integration of Bing
 - Labeling of keypoints


HS ID:
- Gravity Vector
- Name Scoring
